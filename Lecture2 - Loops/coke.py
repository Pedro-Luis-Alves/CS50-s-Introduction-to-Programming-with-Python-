Coke Machine

Suppose that a machine sells bottles of Coca-Cola (Coke) for 50 cents and only 
accepts coins in these denominations: 25 cents, 10 cents, and 5 cents.

In a file called coke.py, implement a program that prompts the user to insert a coin, 
one at a time, each time informing the user of the amount due. Once the user has inputted 
at least 50 cents, output how many cents in change the user is owed. Assume that the user 
will only input integers, and ignore any integer that isnâ€™t an accepted denomination.

amount = 50
print("Amount Due:", amount)

while amount > 0:
    coin = int(input("Insert Coin: "))

    if coin == 5 or coin == 10 or coin == 25:
        amount = amount - coin
    else:
        None
   
    if amount <= 0:
        print("Changed Owed:", amount * -1)
    else:
        print("Amount Due:", amount)
